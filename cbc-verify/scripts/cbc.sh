# cbc.sh - /cbc skill driver: identify mission-critical code, discharge its
# correctness claims through a pluggable verifier, and gate completion.
#
# This is the EPIC-025 driver. identify, verify, status, discharge, and waive
# are implemented; focused CbC skills route to this script where applicable.
#
# See docs/designs/cbc-skill.md and AItools/commands/cbc.md.

# Note: intentionally NOT using `set -e`. The git-attribute parsing relies on
# commands whose non-zero exit is meaningful (e.g. grep/check-attr), and errors
# are propagated via explicit return codes. pipefail is kept so scope-resolution
# failures surface through the identify pipeline.

/cbc <subcommand> [arguments]

  identify  [--scope diff|epic <EID>] [--files "a b c"] [--base <ref>] [--json]
            List CbC-mandatory files in scope (default: working diff vs HEAD).
  verify    <artifact> [--adapter mock|agentic|embedded] [--claim PATH] [--prover NAME]
            Discharge the artifact's claim via a verifier adapter; record evidence.
  status    [<artifact>]
            Show ledger state for an artifact, or a summary across the ledger.
  discharge [--scope diff|epic <EID>] [--files "a b c"] [--strict] [--json]
            Gate: every in-scope CbC-mandatory artifact must be discharged or
            waived. --strict exits non-zero when any remain undischarged.
  waive     <artifact> --reason TEXT
            Record an explicit waiver (rationale) against an artifact.

CbC-mandatory code is tagged via git attributes (cbc=mandatory). Tags are read
here and proposed by the review tooling (TODO-025-006). See
docs/designs/cbc-skill.md.
