# Sovereign Source License (SSL) v0.2

## Preamble

The Sovereign Source License (SSL) extends the Apache License 2.0 to create a sustainable ecosystem for open source development through intelligent data collection and monetization. This license preserves all Apache 2.0 rights and freedoms while adding optional enhanced services that fund continued development through the collection, curation, and sale of development-related data.

Like Apache 2.0, SSL enables unrestricted use, modification, and distribution. Unlike traditional licenses that provide no compensation mechanism, SSL adds an optional ecosystem layer that creates value from the development process itself, benefiting contributors while maintaining complete compatibility with Apache 2.0 usage patterns.

## Definitions

**Note**: This license incorporates and extends all definitions from the Apache License 2.0. The following definitions are additions or clarifications to the Apache 2.0 framework.

1. **Work**: As defined in Apache 2.0 - the work of authorship made available under the License, whether in Source or Object form.

3. **Contributor**: As defined in Apache 2.0 - Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

4. **Smart-Assets.io Ecosystem** *(SSL Extension)*: The optional technical and economic framework consisting of:
   - SSL Data Spigot for LLM interaction routing and data collection
   - SATCHEL cross-chain wallet system for payments and credits
   - Semantic Git repositories for enhanced source code representation
   - Data marketplace for selling curated development datasets

5. **Development Data** *(SSL Extension)*: Information generated through optional ecosystem development activities including:
   - LLM prompts and responses during coding assistance
   - Semantic source code representations and analysis
   - Code contribution patterns and usage metrics
   - Structured specifications and documentation traces

6. **SSL Data Spigot** *(SSL Extension)*: The optional system that routes LLM backend access while collecting, formatting, and curating development data for the ecosystem marketplace.

7. **SATCHEL** *(SSL Extension)*: The optional cross-chain smart contract wallet with integrated payment gateway supporting cryptocurrency transactions and ecosystem credit management.

8. **Ecosystem Credits** *(SSL Extension)*: Optional tokens earned through contributions and participation, redeemable for services, discounts, or direct compensation within the ecosystem.
